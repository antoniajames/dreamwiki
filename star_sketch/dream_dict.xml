  <word def="To see a snake or be bitten by one in your dream signifies hidden 
             fears and worries that are threatening you. 
             Your dream may be alerting you to something in your waking 
             life that you are not aware of or that has not yet surfaced. 
             If you dream that a snake is submerged in water, then it 
             implies that you are unknowingly letting your emotions 
             influence aspects of your life. 
             If the snake tangles itself, 
             then it represents a subsiding threat. 
             Something that you thought was going to be a problem has resolved itself. 
             Alternatively, the snake may be seen as phallic and thus 
             symbolize temptation, dangerous and forbidden sexuality. 
             More specifically, to see a snake on your bed 
             suggests that you are feeling sexually overpowered 
             or sexually threatened. You may be inexperienced, nervous 
             or just unable to keep up. If you are afraid of the snake, 
             then it signifies your fears of sex, intimacy or commitment. 
             The snake may also refer to a person around you who is 
             callous, ruthless, and can't be trusted. 
             As a positive symbol, snakes represent healing, transformation, 
             knowledge and wisdom. It is indicative of self-renewal and positive change. 
             In particular, if you dream of a multi-colored or brightly colored snake,
             then it is a clear warning about something bad happening. 
             Dreaming of a red snake highlights the positive characteristics of the snake, 
             as well as your fiery passion. Seeing a green snake in your dream 
             indicates a misunderstanding. It also symbolizes someone who is not 
             as bad as you had assumed. m" source="http://www.dreammoods.com/">snake</word>
